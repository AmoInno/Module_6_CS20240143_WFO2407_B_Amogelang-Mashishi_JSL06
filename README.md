# Project overview

Build a simple menu display system for a fictional UberEats restaurant called "CodeCuisine." The goal is to display different categories of food items and allow users to add items to their order with a click.

## What to do:

- Create and use functions to dynamically populate the menu items on the page.
- Implement a callback function to handle adding items to the order.
- Use closures to maintain the state of the order.
- Utilize function expressions and anonymous functions.
- Call built-in functions and create custom functions to manage the menu and order system.


## Challenges/Lessons: 
I found it very challenging to dynamically populate the menu items on the page but through practice and persistence, I improved. I consistently continue to improve in my debugging techniques which helped me overcome the issues that I encountered throughout the challenge.
